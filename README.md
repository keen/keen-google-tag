# keen-google-tag

Google Tag Manager Tag Template for Keen.io's JavaScript tracking library. The Tag Template is currently in the early stages of development and right now is considered as experimental.

The template file currently reflects the initial working version which has been tested. It allows tracking of events from the data layer for analytics processing. The template allows to easily stream Google Tag Manager data layer events into our managed timeseries data and analytics platform.

You must specify the URL for the tracking library, project id, API write key, and the name of the event collection you want stream your date into. Reach out to learn more, or if you would like to test it out.
